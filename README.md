A modern and responsive college website built with React.js, designed for Edusity, an academic institution. The platform includes core sections such as program listings, faculty profiles, admissions information, news & announcements, and a contact form. Built entirely with reusable React components, it ensures scalability and performance.

The project demonstrates clean component architecture, routing with React Router, dynamic content handling, and a user-first design. Though it doesnâ€™t include a backend, it is fully structured to integrate APIs or CMS solutions as needed. The UI was crafted with accessibility and modern design practices in mind, making it a strong frontend foundation for any educational institution.
